## Overview
The original database had several issues and was missing essential tables for a tailor business. This document outlines all the improvements and corrections made, following the original flow with separate stock management.

## Major Issues Fixed

- **Fixed**: Standardized all monetary fields to `decimal(15,2)` for proper financial calculations
- **Original**: Inconsistent field lengths and types
- **Fixed**: Proper field types and lengths for each purpose

### 2. **Missing Essential Tables**
- **Added**: `system_settings` - Company information and system configuration
- **Added**: `notifications` - User notification system
- **Added**: `cash_transactions` - Detailed cash flow tracking
- **Enhanced**: `roles` - Proper user role management with permissions

### 3. **Foreign Key Constraints**
- **Original**: No foreign key relationships
- **Fixed**: Proper foreign key constraints for data integrity
- **Benefits**: Prevents orphaned records, ensures data consistency

### 4. **Missing Fields for Tailor Business**
- **Added**: `delivery_date` in sales table for order tracking
- **Added**: `status` fields with proper enums for workflow management
- **Added**: `reference_no` for payment tracking
- **Added**: `created_by` and `created_at` for audit trails

## Database Flow (Following Original Structure)

### **Inventory Management Flow:**
1. **Products** → Defines product information (name, category, description)

5. **Sale** → Creates sales orders
6. **Sale Items** → Individual items in sales, linked to stock items

### **Key Benefits of This Flow:**
