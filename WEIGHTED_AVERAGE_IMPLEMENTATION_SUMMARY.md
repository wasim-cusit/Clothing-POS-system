# Weighted Average Pricing Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes all the changes made to implement a weighted average pricing system for stock management in the tailor shop application.

## Problem Solved
The user wanted to understand how to handle different purchase prices for the same product (e.g., 23 units at 400 PKR and 15 units at 650 PKR) and get accurate average pricing that considers quantities.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Updated `stock.php`**
- **File**: `stock.php`
- **Changes**:
  - Added weighted average calculations to SQL query
  - Added new table columns for weighted averages
  - Updated table headers and data display
  - Fixed colspan for "No stock items found" message

#### SQL Query Updates
```sql
-- Before (Simple Average)
COALESCE(AVG(si.purchase_price), 0) as avg_purchase_price,
COALESCE(AVG(si.sale_price), 0) as avg_sale_price,

-- After (Added Weighted Average)
COALESCE(AVG(si.purchase_price), 0) as avg_purchase_price,
COALESCE(AVG(si.sale_price), 0) as avg_sale_price,
COALESCE(SUM(si.quantity * si.purchase_price) / SUM(si.quantity), 0) as weighted_avg_purchase_price,
COALESCE(SUM(si.quantity * si.sale_price) / SUM(si.quantity), 0) as weighted_avg_sale_price
```

#### New Table Columns
- **Weighted Avg Purchase**: Shows quantity-weighted average purchase price
- **Weighted Avg Sale**: Shows quantity-weighted average sale price

### 2. **Updated `add_sale.php`**
- **File**: `add_sale.php`
- **Changes**:
  - Updated product query to use weighted averages for purchase and sale prices
  - This affects the product dropdown pricing information

#### Before
```sql
ROUND(COALESCE(AVG(si.sale_price), 0), 2) as sale_price,
ROUND(COALESCE(AVG(si.purchase_price), 0), 2) as purchase_price
```

#### After
```sql
ROUND(COALESCE(SUM(si.quantity * si.sale_price) / SUM(si.quantity), 0), 2) as sale_price,
ROUND(COALESCE(SUM(si.quantity * si.purchase_price) / SUM(si.quantity), 0), 2) as purchase_price
```

### 3. **Updated `sales.php`**
- **File**: `sales.php`
- **Changes**:
  - Updated product query to use weighted averages for purchase and sale prices
  - This affects the product dropdown pricing information in sales

#### Same SQL Update as add_sale.php
- Changed from simple `AVG()` to weighted average calculation

## New Features

### 1. **Dual Average Display**
- **Simple Average**: Traditional average of all prices (equal weight)
- **Weighted Average**: Quantity-based average (more accurate for business)

### 2. **Enhanced Stock Table**
- Shows both types of averages side by side
- Weighted averages are highlighted with bold text
- Clear labeling for quantity-based calculations

### 3. **Improved Product Dropdowns**
- Sales and purchase forms now show weighted average prices
- More accurate pricing information for business decisions

## Example Output

For a product with:
- 23 units at 400 PKR
- 15 units at 650 PKR

| Metric | Simple Average | Weighted Average |
|--------|----------------|------------------|
| **Purchase Price** | 525.00 PKR | 498.68 PKR |
| **Sale Price** | 625.00 PKR | 598.68 PKR |

### 2. **Application Level**
- Automatic updates when stock changes

- Moving average calculations

### 2. **Advanced Analytics**
- Price trend analysis
